# R2 Markdown Sync - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

A complete Obsidian vault synchronization solution using Cloudflare Workers and R2 storage. Features a modern Node.js uploader with parallel processing and a beautiful web interface for browsing files.

## ✅ Problems Fixed

### 1. **URL Encoding Issue** ❌ → ✅

**Problem:** Filenames with Cyrillic characters and special characters were being stored with URL encoding (`%D0%A2%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82`).

**Solution:** Added `decodeURIComponent()` in the worker to decode URLs before storing:

```javascript
const key = decodeURIComponent(url.pathname.slice(1));
```

**Result:** Files now store with original names: `Тестовий файл.md` ✓

### 2. **Bash Script Limitations** ❌ → ✅

**Problems:**

- Poor error messages
- No progress tracking
- Limited Unicode support on some systems
- Hard to extend with new features

**Solution:** Created professional Node.js uploader (`upload.js`) with:

- ✅ Parallel uploads (4 workers by default, configurable)
- ✅ Beautiful colored console output with emojis
- ✅ Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ Upload statistics (speed, duration, size)
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Full Unicode support

**Example Output:**

```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║   R2 Markdown Sync - Obsidian → R2        ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════╝

✓ PROJECT_JIJA/02 - Музика/Гітара.md (3.2 KB)
✓ Homepage.md (2.5 KB)
Progress: 57/57 (100%)

Avg speed: 150 KB/s
```

### 3. **No Web Interface** ❌ → ✅

**Problem:** No way to browse files without manual API calls.

**Solution:** Created beautiful web frontend with:

- ✅ Embedded directly in the worker (single deployment)
- ✅ Real-time file search and filtering
- ✅ File statistics dashboard
- ✅ Download and view functionality
- ✅ Responsive gradient UI design
- ✅ Loading states and error handling

**Access:** Visit your worker URL directly (e.g., `https://r2-worker.jija.workers.dev`)

## 📊 Test Results

All tests passing! ✅

```
✓ Upload file with Cyrillic characters
✓ Retrieve uploaded file
✓ List all files

## 🔧 Technical Details

### URL Encoding Fix

```javascript
// Before: Stored as "Test%2FFile.md"
const key = url.pathname.slice(1);

// After: Stored as "Test/File.md"
const key = decodeURIComponent(url.pathname.slice(1));
```

### Unicode Support

Works perfectly with:

- ✅ Cyrillic: `Дофамін.md`
- ✅ Spaces: `Daily Note.md`
- ✅ Special chars: `Test (2024).md`
- ✅ Nested paths: `PROJECT_JIJA/02 - Музика/Гітара.md`

### CORS Headers

```javascript
'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS'
'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type'
```

## 📈 Performance

### Upload Speed

- **Parallel jobs:** 4 (default)
- **Average speed:** ~150 KB/s (depends on connection)
- **Timeout:** 60 seconds per file
- **Recommended:** 57 files in ~8 seconds

### R2 Storage

- **No egress fees** - Free downloads!
- **Fast reads** - CDN-backed
- **Scalable** - No practical limits

## 🎯 Next Steps (See TODO.md)

Priority features for next version:

1. **Incremental sync** - Only upload changed files
2. **Bi-directional sync** - Download from R2
3. **Authentication** - API key protection
4. **File versioning** - Keep history
5. **Watch mode** - Auto-sync on changes
