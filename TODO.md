## üêõ Known Issues

### To Fix

- [x] Filenames with %XX encoding in bash script
- [ ] Vitest integration tests failing (need to investigate worker pool config)
- [ ] Large file uploads (>100MB) may timeout
- [ ] No progress indication for individual files in parallel upload

### To Investigate

- [ ] Memory usage with very large vaults (10,000+ files)
- [ ] Rate limiting on Cloudflare Workers
- [ ] R2 bucket size limits

## üìù Notes

### Architecture Decisions

- **Why Node.js uploader over bash?**
  - Better cross-platform support
  - More reliable error handling
  - Easier to extend with features
  - Better Unicode handling
- **Why embed frontend in worker?**
  - Single deployment (no separate hosting)
  - Automatic HTTPS
  - No CORS issues
  - Faster initial load

### Performance Considerations

- Parallel uploads default to 4 workers (good balance for most connections)
- Can be increased for faster connections (up to 10-15)
- R2 has no egress fees (great for downloads)
- Worker has 50ms CPU limit per request (should be fine for most operations)

### Security Considerations

- Currently no authentication (anyone with URL can access)
- Should add API key authentication for production use
- CORS is wide open (\* for all origins) - OK for personal use, should restrict for teams
- Consider adding rate limiting to prevent abuse
