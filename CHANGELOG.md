## Migration Guide

### From 0.0.0 to 1.0.0

#### Files Already Uploaded with Encoded Names

Your existing files in R2 have URL-encoded names. Options:

1. **Re-upload** (recommended):

   ```bash
   npm run upload
   ```

   This will upload with proper names. You can then manually delete old encoded files.

2. **Keep both** (temporary):
   Old encoded files will remain accessible but new uploads will use proper names.

#### Bash Script Users

Replace:

```bash
./run.sh
```

With:

```bash
npm run upload
```

Benefits:

- Better progress tracking
- Error handling
- Statistics
- Configurable parallel jobs

#### API Users

Add support for new `/_list` endpoint:

```javascript
// List all files
const response = await fetch('https://worker.dev/_list');
const files = await response.json();
```
